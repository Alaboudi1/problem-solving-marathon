## Let's do a problem-solving marathon!**

Every day we will post a simple Java Problem and we will solve it together.

## Instructions: 

Fork this repository: https://github.com/jugbd/problem-solving-marathon

There will be a readme file where you will find the problem description. Besides this, there will be an incomplete Java file in the source directory and test suites in the test source directory. Your job is to pass the test cases. 

You can help this marathon in multiple ways- 
1. Suggest a problem.
2. Edit this readme file
3. Enrich the test suites
4. Solve the problem and send a pull request.

End of the marathon we will announce the best contributors and there will be rewards for them.
